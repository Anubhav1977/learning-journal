# ⚛️ React Project One

This is my first React project, built as part of my learning journey in modern frontend development.  
The project focuses on understanding React basics — components, JSX, props, and state management.

## 🧠 **Goal**
To build a strong foundation in React before moving to advanced topics like routing, hooks, and API integration.
